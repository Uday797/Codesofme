            Inside the Mind of a Detective: Skills and Qualities Necessary to Become a Detective
A detective is an independent professional who carries out investigations and examines situations and people to accumulate data for their clients. For an investigator, it is just as important to interrogate people as it is to conduct surveillance. They have to do paperwork, record the responses and observe what was unsaid.

To become a successful field agent, one must be dual skilled in mental agility and physical flexibility. It is asked of a detective to possess a perfect balance between his/her brain and his/her heart. Starting with a good academic background, a knack of dealing with people, great writing skills, emotional maturity and flexibility in the legwork, a detective can become proficient and effective in the field very soon.

They give a damn and don't give up.   
        The most important set of skills needed by a detective are the investigative skills that they gain along the way throughout the course of their education and training. Many law enforcement officials are required to have an associate's degree or higher, according to the BLS, and the research skills gained along the way can prove invaluable for detective work. Detectives who have a degree in police science, criminal justice or criminology will gain many of the necessary skills utilized by law enforcement officials. Other skills, such as those used in crime scene investigation, are learned as part of police academy training and as part of hands-on experience from working in the field.
